we use the integers a, b, and n to create the following series:
(a+2^0*b), (a+2^0*b + 2¹*b), ..., (a+2^0*b + 2¹*b + ... + 2^n-1*b)

you are given q queries in the form of a, b and n. For each query, print the series corresponding to the given a, b and n values as a single line of n space-separated integers.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer, q, denoting the number of queries.
Each line i of the q subsequent lines contains three space-separated integers describing the respective a, b, and n  values for that query.

Sample input:
2
0 2 10
5 3 5

Sample output
2 6 14 30 62 126 254 510 1022 2046
8 14 26 50 98
